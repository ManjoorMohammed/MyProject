# Basic Banking System in Python


This repository contains a simple Python program that simulates a basic banking system. Users can create accounts, log in, and perform basic banking operations like deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.

## Features

- Account Creation: Users can create new accounts by providing their name, age, mobile number, and password. An account number is generated based on user information.

- Account Login: Users can log in using their account number and password. The program validates the login credentials and allows users to access their accounts.

- Deposit: Logged-in users can deposit money into their accounts. The deposit amount is added to the account balance.

- Withdrawal: Logged-in users can withdraw money from their accounts, provided they have sufficient balance. The withdrawal amount is subtracted from the account balance.

- Check Balance: Users can view their account balance at any time.
